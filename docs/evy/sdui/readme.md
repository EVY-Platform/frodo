# SDUI

## Data

Whenever flows are sent to a client app, any static data that is necessary is also passed. For example, the values of "10 min, 20 min, 30 min" for the distance that someone is willing to travel to to deliver an item is passed in along with the flows for items, along with a UUID which identifies that data within the UI data.

```
{
    _flow1_
        _pages_
            _rows_
    _flow2_
        _pages_
            _rows_
    ...
    _data_: {
        "254190d9-0a99-43d0-a3c2-f222bdec1893": [{
            "id": "68e52916-7a07-4a07-ae0c-52e7800b9b9f",
            "value": "5 min",
        },{
            "id": "8e1cd2bf-d94f-4bb0-bd68-fc74434deabe",
            "value": "10 min",
        },{
            "id": "1eedac33-eb0b-4796-9853-50ad4036179f",
            "value": "15 min",
        },{
            "id": "69f25102-822c-436c-a6c1-3b49f887355e",
            "value": "30 min",
        }]
    }
}
```

## Flow

Flows are not visually used in the UI but represent a full user journey (eg: creating an item)  
They are needed in order to submit all fields of all pages of a flow at the end upon clicking a single button on a page

```
{
    "id",
    "name",

    // Which service the flow belongs to, eg "marketplace"
    // This is not used on the client apps, only server-side
    "service",

    // The type of flow that it is: Create, Read, Update, Delete
    "type",

    // What is the data that the page is acting on, eg "item"
    "data": "model_name"

    "pages": [PAGE]
}
```

## Page

```
{
    // Shown in the navbar
    "title",

    // The rows that are on the page
    "rows": [ROW],

    // Shown as sticky footer
    "footer": ROW
}
```

## Row

Rows are what are put into pages. They are the building block of the EVY SDUI framework

### Base features

-   All values are strings, there are no types as this is dynamic on the apps
    -   eg: "title": "My title", could also be "title": "{item.title}"
-   All strings can include:
    -   **variables** surrounded with curley braces: "Hello {name}, how are you?"
    -   **icons** surrounded with double colons: "EVY ::evy_icon:: is the best!"
    -   **emojis** prefixed with a colon: "I like :dog a lot"
-   [ x ]
    -   Denotes a type array of x
-   Objects and arrays
    -   When objects or arrays are passed into a prop of content, they are parsed fully by the SDUI framework. Eg: "{item.tags}" will become "[{id": a, "value": "Furniture"}, {id": a, "value": "Chair"}]"

### Row schema explanained

```
{
    // The type of row that it is, Button, Text, Calendar, etc
    "type",

    // The visible part of the row, what to show to the user
    "view": {
        // What text in what fields
        content: {
            // Represents the header of the row, if empty string then no header will be shown
            "title",

            // Each subsequent key/value pair represents a line of content shown on a row
            // the key is the name, the value is what the content is or where it's from
            //eg "subtitle": "My great subtitle"
        },
        // Some types of rows need data, for example dropdowns, or search bars
        data: {
            "value": "String"
        }
    },
    // The edit part of the row, what to do when editing the row
    "edit": {
        // Where the input data is stored
        "destination",

        // Whether this row is required for a page to be considered complete
        "validation": {
            "required", // Yes or no
            "message", // What to show if the validation fails
            "minAmount", // Minimum amount of items
            "minValue", // Minimum value
            "minCharacters" // Minimum characters
        }

    },

    // What action should be taken when tapping the button
    "action": {
        "target": "navigate:flow_id:page_id|submit|close",
    }
}
```
